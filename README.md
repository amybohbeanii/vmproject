## Description

This student project was created as part of Olin College of Engineeringâ€™s Software Systems course. For more details on this project, see the final report.h

Virtual Memory is an important concept of an Operating System. To grasp the concept, our team decided to analyze the different components and techniques in VM. A comprehensive understanding of VM means knowing how virtual addresses are mapped to physical addresses. The concept is that virtual memory allows more memory to be used than physically available. The main component that allows this concept to work is the page table and the techniques are the various page replacement algorithms. 

## Setup and Usage

To compile the project from source, simply run `make` in the root directory.

To run the program: ./virtmem npages nframes rand|fifo|custom scan|sort|focus

Examples to run the project:

./virtmem 15 10 rand sort

./virtmem 15 10 fifo focus
